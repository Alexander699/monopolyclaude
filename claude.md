## Recent Changes (Latest First)

### v0.6 - Multiplayer Debugging (Current)
- **Extensive debugging for multiplayer**:
  - Added detailed console logging throughout network.js and ui.js
  - Logs show connection state, player joins, and game-start message flow
  - Host shows "Start Game (Host)" button, clients show "Waiting for host" message
  - Connection status logged when players join (conn.open state)
- **Debug output locations**:
  - `[HOST]` prefixed logs in green for host actions
  - `[CLIENT]` prefixed logs in green for client actions
  - `[UI-HOST]` and `[UI-CLIENT]` logs in UI callbacks
  - Error logs in red for failures

### v0.5 - UI Overhaul & Multiplayer Fixes
- **Multiplayer improvements**:
  - Only host can start the game (removed start button for clients)
  - Fixed board sync breaking after 2 turns (improved state merging)
  - Global News cards now display to ALL players, not just the one who landed
  - Added `global-news` network message type for card broadcasting
- **UI Redesign**:
  - Chat moved to bottom-right corner, always visible (no button needed)
  - Space detail card only shows to active player when buying (not to spectators)
  - Dice centered prominently in board center with total display
  - Game branding moved below dice (smaller, less intrusive)
  - Right panel reorganized: Action Panel → Chat
- **New Features**:
  - Player movement animation (tokens bounce when moving)
  - Dice total displayed below dice after roll
- **Code Improvements**:
  - `sendChatMessage()` helper function for consistent chat handling
  - `animatePlayerMovement()` function for smooth token movement
  - Better state synchronization with deep merge for nested objects

### v0.4 - Multiplayer Fixes
- **Improved multiplayer reliability**:
  - Rewrote network.js with better connection handling
  - Added connection retry logic (up to 4 attempts)
  - Added detailed colored console logging for debugging
  - Host now properly broadcasts state changes to all clients
  - Game start now correctly sends state to all connected players
  - Added `canPerformAction()` check to prevent clients from acting on others' turns
- **Fixed dice rolling bug**: Dice animation no longer gets stuck
  - Animation flags properly managed with dual flag system
  - Rolling class immediately removed when animation completes
  - Blocked rolls now clear animation state

### v0.3 - Bug Fixes
- **Fixed flag emoji display**: Country flags now display properly on Windows
  - Flag emojis were showing as letter codes (e.g., "IN" instead of 🇮🇳)
  - Added `getFlagHtml()` function that uses flagcdn.com images as fallback
  - Flags now use actual PNG images from CDN for cross-platform compatibility
- **UI improvements**:
  - Player tokens increased to 24px with pulse animation
  - Flags increased to 22px with drop-shadow
  - Dice display always visible and larger (52px)

### v0.2 - Debug Tools
- Added comprehensive debug console commands
- `window.enableDebug()` enables debug mode
- Debug commands: giveMoney, giveProperty, giveInfluence, moveTo, etc.

### v0.1 - Initial Release
- Complete game implementation with all mechanics
- Local hot-seat multiplayer
- PeerJS online multiplayer (unreliable)

## Known Issues & TODO

### Multiplayer Limitations
**Note**: PeerJS WebRTC connections can be unreliable in some scenarios:
- Same browser tabs (use different browsers for testing)
- Strict firewalls/NAT (may block peer-to-peer connections)
- Some corporate networks

**Current Workarounds**:
- TURN servers configured for better NAT traversal
- Connection retry logic (up to 4 attempts)
- Colored console logging for debugging ([HOST] green, [CLIENT] green, errors red)

**Future Solution**: Replace PeerJS with WebSocket server for 100% reliable connections

**Solution Needed**: Replace PeerJS with WebSocket server:
1. Create Node.js/Express + Socket.io backend
2. Host on Render.com (free tier) or similar
3. Server acts as message relay, no peer-to-peer needed
4. 100% reliable connections

### Testing Multiplayer Locally
Current workaround for local testing:
1. Use two different browsers (Chrome + Firefox)
2. Or use Chrome + Chrome Incognito (different sessions)
3. Open DevTools console (F12) to see connection logs

### Other TODOs
- [ ] Implement proper WebSocket multiplayer backend
- [ ] Add turn timer option
- [ ] Spectator mode
- [ ] Reconnection handling (player disconnect/rejoin)
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements
- [ ] Add more card variety
- [ ] Auction system when player declines to buy

- `GameEngine` class:
  - State management and event emission
  - `rollDiceAction()` - Handle dice roll
  - `movePlayer()` / `movePlayerTo()` - Movement logic

### network.js (NEEDS REPLACEMENT)
- `NetworkManager` class
- Uses PeerJS for WebRTC

- Clients connect via room code
- Currently unreliable - needs WebSocket replacement

### soundManager.js
- `SoundManager` class using Web Audio API
- Generates tones procedurally (no audio files needed)
- Methods: playDiceRoll, playPurchase, playRentPaid, playVictory, etc.

## Architecture Notes

### State Flow
```
User Action → UI Handler → GameEngine method → State Update → emit() → render()
```

### Board Coordinate System
- 11x11 CSS Grid
- `getSpacePosition(id)` converts space ID (0-39) to {row, col}
- Clockwise: Bottom (0-10) → Left (11-20) → Top (21-30) → Right (31-39)
- Grid positions are 1-indexed in CSS

### Rendering
- Full re-render on state change (simple but works)
- Template literals for HTML generation
- Event listeners re-attached after each render

## Deployment Notes

### Static Hosting (Current - Local Game Only)
Works on: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, any static host
- Local multiplayer (hot-seat) works fine
- Online multiplayer unreliable due to WebRTC issues

### With Backend Server (TODO)
For reliable online multiplayer:
1. Deploy static files to Netlify/GitHub Pages
2. Deploy WebSocket server to Render.com
3. Update network.js to use WebSocket instead of PeerJS
4. Configure CORS properly

## Testing & Debug Mode

### Testing Multiplayer Locally
PeerJS doesn't work well with same-browser tabs. Use one of these:
1. **Two different browsers**: Chrome + Firefox
2. **Chrome + Incognito**: Normal window + Incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N)
3. **Just test locally**: Use hot-seat mode (all players on same device)

### Debug Console Commands
Open browser DevTools (F12), go to Console tab, then:

```javascript
// Enable debug mode first
window.enableDebug()

// Available commands:
window.debug.giveMoney(5000)              // Give current player $5000
window.debug.giveProperty(14)             // Give property (India is id 14)
window.debug.giveInfluence(500)           // Give 500 influence
window.debug.moveTo(10)                   // Move to Trade Sanctions
window.debug.completeAlliance('EASTERN')  // Give all Eastern Partnership countries
window.debug.drawCard('globalNews')       // Draw a Global News card
window.debug.bankruptPlayer(1)            // Bankrupt player at index 1
window.debug.simulateTurn()               // Roll dice and move
window.debug.forceEndTurn()               // Force end current turn
window.debug.skipToPlayer(2)              // Skip to player index 2
window.debug.getState()                   // View full game state
window.debug.listSpaces()                 // List all 40 board spaces
window.debug.listAlliances()              // List all alliances
```
